% Returns a two-dimensional mimetic curl operator

% Parameters:
%                k : Order of accuracy
%                m : Number of cells along x-axis
%               dx : Step size along x-axis
%                n : Number of cells along y-axis
%               dy : Step size along y-axis
%      west, east,
%     south, north : west, east, south, north limits
%                U : Vector space function acting on x-direction
%                    U(X,Y) must be defined as function handle
%                V : Vector space function acting on y-direction
%                    V(X,Y) must be defined as function handle
